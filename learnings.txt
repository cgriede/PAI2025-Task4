initialization of the actor weights is extremely important since
using wrong initialization or wrong seed in initialization gives bad results for training
performance

performance of the algorithm is highly dependant on the learning rates chosen. If we take slightly too high learning rates then the algorithm will collapse
to some nonsensical solution for certain seeds.

model complexity is also really important since choosing a too large network for the actor for example produces unstable results (stable shitty results)
